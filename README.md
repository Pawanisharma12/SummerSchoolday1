README – HTML Fundamentals Assignment
Summer School Program – IIT Jammu

This project is my submission for the HTML Fundamentals Assignment. I created a basic personal portfolio website with three pages: portfolio.html, about.html, and contact.html.

-----------------------------------
1. portfolio.html – Main Portfolio Page
-----------------------------------
This is the main page of the website. It includes:
- All six heading levels from h1 to h6 to show hierarchy.
- A navigation menu at the top with links to the other two pages.
- An unordered list to show my technical skills.
- An ordered list for my education background.
- An image with proper alt text to represent me.
- A table showing my project experience, including the project name, role, and duration.

I used semantic tags like <header>, <main>, <section>, and <footer> to structure the page clearly.

-----------------------------------
2. about.html – About Me Page
-----------------------------------
This page includes:
- A short paragraph about myself and my interests.
- Headings to organize the content properly.
- An internal link back to the home page (portfolio.html).
- An external link to W3Schools to show where I’ve learned some HTML basics.

This page helps the viewer know more about me in a simple and direct way.

-----------------------------------
3. contact.html – Contact Form Page
-----------------------------------
This page contains a complete contact form, which includes:
- Text input for name
- Email input
- Tel input for phone number
- Textarea for the message
- Checkboxes for preferred contact methods (Email, Phone, Text)
- Radio buttons for inquiry type (General, Business, Support)
- A dropdown menu to select reason for contact
- A date input to choose a preferred contact date
- A range slider to show urgency level
- A submit button to complete the form

Validation is added using `required` in the important fields. Semantic HTML5 tags like <header>, <nav>, and <main> are also used here.

-----------------------------------
CSS Enhancements (Part 2)
-----------------------------------
Although this assignment focused on HTML, I also added:
- A dropdown, date, and range input to enhance the form
- Proper structure using semantic tags
- Form fields with `required` and pattern validation for better user experience

-----------------------------------
What I Learned
-----------------------------------
This project helped me understand how to:
- Build a multi-page HTML website
- Use various HTML form elements
- Organize content using headings, tables, lists, and semantic tags
- Add validation and structure to a real-world contact form

Overall, it was a helpful exercise to improve my confidence with writing HTML from scratch.

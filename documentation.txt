- select – For dropdown with predefined contact reasons
- date – To let users pick a preferred contact date
- range – It is used to select urgency level from 1 to 5

Q3. How my navigation structure works:

- In Each page I include a nav bar,<nav> or navigation menu inside the <header>
- The menu contains links:
  - portfolio.html :This is for (Home)
  - about.html:This is for  (About Me)
  - contact.html :This is for (Contact)
- Links are internal and use relative paths (no external page navigation)
- They help the user move easily between pages.
